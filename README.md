Bigbasket Customer Analytics

The "Big Basket" project leverages Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to optimize the operations of an online grocery platform, with Python serving as the primary tool due to its powerful libraries for data science and machine learning. Key techniques such as Data Preprocessing, Filtering, Encoding, Serialization, Clustering, Entropy, and Algorithm Training are employed to extract meaningful insights and improve overall system functionality.

Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy are used for efficient data manipulation and preprocessing, ensuring high-quality inputs for model development. Scikit-learn and TensorFlow facilitate the creation and training of machine learning models, enhancing customer recommendations, inventory management, and demand forecasting. Serialization techniques, such as those provided by Pickle and Joblib, enable the storage and reuse of trained models, improving system efficiency.

The project emphasizes the practical use of clustering algorithms, entropy calculations, and feature engineering to enhance decision-making processes within the platform. By utilizing Python's extensive ecosystem, the project aims to develop a robust, scalable system tailored to the dynamic needs of the online grocery domain. Through the integration of advanced algorithms, the platform becomes more intelligent and responsive to customer behavior and market trends, ultimately improving the user experience and operational efficiency.
